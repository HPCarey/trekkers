## **Manual Testing**

* This site was tested manually by:
    - Testing the UI and functionality of features for different device sizes and browsers.
    - Evaluating performance and loading times using lighthouse and interacting wiht the site as a user.
    - Ensuring that user story features are functioning as they should be with the expected outcome from specific user actions.
    - All links and user pathways function as intended and navigate the user as expected through the site.
* The details of how the manual testing was carried out can be seen below.
* I have also included the code validation in the TESTING document.

## Responsive Testing
<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

* Site resonsivity was tested using google chrome DevTools and with my own Galaxy S20 FE.
* The screenshot below shows a list of the devices that were tested via chrome devtools:


    ![responsive](readme/desktop-testing/devtools-responsive-testing.png)

[Back to top](#testing)

* The site was shown to be fully responsive, readable and functional on all of the tested devices.
* The "trekkers" site name navlink in the navbar is set to be hidden in screen sizes under 365px in order to prevent the navbar UI becoming crowded and distorted.
*  In Chrome devtools most mobile screen sizes are still wide enough to display the "trekkers" heading.
* The screens where it is hidden are :
    - Samsung galaxy S8+
    - Galaxy fold
* On my own phone model (Galaxy S20 FE), the "trekkers" navlink heading is hidden.

* Site resposivity was also tested on Amiresponsive as seen in the README.
* Below is a screenshot of the viewport sizes tested on amiresponsive:

 ![amiresponsive](readme/desktop-testing/amiresponsive-viewport-sizes.JPG)

* I also included some screenshots of features in mobile size in the user story testing to show the responsive design.

## Code Validation

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

1. ### **HTML Validation**

HTML validation was done using 
[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). In order to validate the HTML without getting errors due to the Django template tags, the following steps were followed:

1. Navigate to the deployed site url using the google chrome browser.
2. Navigate to the page of the site you want to validate.
3. Right click anywhere on said page and select "View page source".
4. Copy the source code and open the validator.
5. Select Validate by direct input and paste the code into the validator field and click "Check"

Below are the issues encountered during initial validation: 

**Home Page**

* A warning to add a language attribute to the html tag
* Several Info messages to remove trailing / from self-closing elements like img and link. 
* I discovered that these / were getting added automatically whenever I used the prettier command to tidy up the template code.

**Add booking form page**

* An attribute error for using "placeholder" with date input. The source of this error was in the forms.py date widget. I simply removed the placeholder attribute.
* The end tag error and unlcosed element were related. Both errors were dealt with upon locating the unclosed div and closing it.

**Update booking form page**

* Unsurprisingly the same unclosed div error results occured on this page as the one in the booking form page. Since I create the update form template by copy, pasting and making adjustments to the booking form, this was expected and fixed in the same manner.

2. ### CSS Validation
CSS Validation was done using [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* One error occured for the .btn-secodary class. Too many values. 
* I am not 100% sure, but I think perhaps this error occured becasue I had already targeted the buttons with these rules somewhere else already.

![CSS](static/readme/testing/code-validation/css-validator-error.JPG)

* After playing around with this css for a bit I realised that the particular rule was not really making a differnece to the display and after commenting it out to be sure I decide to delete it.
* After double checking all my styles were working ok, I ran the css through the validator again and it came up clean.

3. ### Python Validation
 Python Validation was done using the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).
 I used the gitpod problems tab to minimise python code errors as I went along, so there were not that many errors to address from passing the code through the linter. 

#### **Profject files**

**settings.py**
* Initial warnings for this file were as seen in this screenshot:

    ![settings-warning](static/readme/testing/python-code-validation/settings_warnings.JPG)

* The settings.py line too long warnings are from the django password validators. 
    ![settings-warning](static/readme/testing/python-code-validation/auth-password-validators.JPG)

* After consulting my own mentor and other mentors on slack, I left the too long lines in this particular case as they are part of the django automated code and splitting the string up might lead to unforseen issues. 
* The final validation results look like this:
