## **Manual Testing**

* This site was tested manually by:
    - Testing the UI and functionality of features for different device sizes and browsers.
    - Evaluating performance and loading times using lighthouse and interacting wiht the site as a user.
    - Ensuring that user story features are functioning as they should be with the expected outcome from specific user actions.
    - All links and user pathways function as intended and navigate the user as expected through the site.
* The details of how the manual testing was carried out can be seen below.
* I have also included the code validation in the TESTING document.

## Responsive Testing
<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

* Site resonsivity was tested using google chrome DevTools and with my own Galaxy S20 FE 5G.
* The screenshot below shows a list of the devices that were tested. 


    ![responsive](static/readme/testing/responsive.png)

* The site was shown to be fully responsive, readable and functional on all of the tested devices.
* One minor issue showed up with the buttons on the update form page which did not display side by side but rather one above the other on the Surface Pro, iPad mini, iPad Air and the Galaxy fold. This appeared to be a minor issue only affecting UI design and not functionality or readability. On most devices it displayed correctly.

* Site resposivity was also tested on Amiresponsive as seen in the README.
* I also included some screenshots of features in mobile size in the user story testing to show the responsive design.

### Epic 3: Posts


<details>
<summary>User Stories test cases</summary>
<br>

#### **User Stories**
12. Create a post: As a **logged in user** I can **create a new post** so that I can **share my experiences and suggestions for good hikes and walks I‚Äôve been on**.

    - Logged in users have access to the add post form and can create a post about their trail.

    ![add-post-form](readme/desktop-testing/add-post-page.JPG)
    
    - Each add post form handles errors for blank, required fields and for incorrect field values.

        ![add-post-form-errors](readme/desktop-testing/add-post-error-message.JPG) 
        ![add-post-form-errors](readme/desktop-testing/form-field-error.JPG) 
        ![add-post-form-rating-error](readme/desktop-testing/rating-value-error.JPG) 


    - Images over 2mb will throw an error to conserve cloud storage space.
            ![add-post-form-errors](readme/desktop-testing/image-too-large-error.JPG)

    - Once an image has been uploaded to the form a change image utton will appear to allow user to change the image.
        ![add-post-form](readme/desktop-testing/change-image-button-diff-dropdown.JPG)
    - There is a dropdown menu containing 4 choices of difficulty level with the default value set to easy.
    - A star rating value is also requires a value of at least 1 out of 5 stars.

        ![add-post-form-end](readme/desktop-testing/end-of-add-post-form.JPG)

    - Once the user clicks create and all fields are valid, the post will be published to the homepage and the user's profile page.
    - Once the user clicks create they are redirected to the post detail page, where they can take further actions related to the post.
    - If the user clicks cancel instead of create, they will be redirected to the home page instead.


[Back to top](#testing)

13. Edit a post: As a **logged in user** I can**edit my post** so that I can **revise my content**

    - Post owners have the ability to edit their posts from the post detail page via the three dot dropdown menu.

        ![edit-post-form](readme/desktop-testing/post-detail-three-dots-sm.jpg)

    - The edit form has all the original values pre-populated in the form fields, with the exception of the star rating value which does not display the stars filled in. 
        - note: the original value is still passed to the edit form and if the user adjusts other values the original rating value will remain, but it is an unsolved bug that the stars don't display the value in the edit form. 
    - The same field errors are handled as in the add post form but as the fields are pre-populated the blank field error only occurs for trail name and country when the user physically deletes the value and leaves them blank. 
    - All fields have been tested to see if the edited value is updated as expected and in each case they pass. 
    - If all form fields are valid and the user clicks save, they are redirected to the post detail again.
    - If the user clicks cancel in this case they will be redirected to the post details page.

    ![edit-post-form](readme/desktop-testing/edit-form.JPG)

14. Delete a post: As a **logged in user** I can **delete my post** so that I can **remove content I have posted**

    - Post owners have the ability to delete their posts via the post detail page.
    - Post detail displays a three dot dropdown menu to users who are the post owner.
    - If the user clicks delete the post will be removed from the site and the user will be redirected to whatever page they navigated to the posts detail from, ie. their own profile or the home page.
    - In the Backend API the post model has an ondelete cascade so all comments and likes associated with the post will be deleted.

    - Authorised user can view their appointments in their Appointments page.
    - Each appointment displays a change and delete button as seen in the previous test case pictures.
    - There is defensive programming in place to prevent users from accidentally deleting an appointment.
    - If a user clicks the delete button, they will be redirected to a confirmation page where they will be asked to confirm their delete decision.

    ![desktop-form-buttons](static/readme/testing/cancel-confirmation-page.JPG)

## Code Validation

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

1. ### **HTML Validation**

HTML validation was done using 
[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). In order to validate the HTML without getting errors due to the Django template tags, the following steps were followed:

1. Navigate to the deployed site url using the google chrome browser.
2. Navigate to the page of the site you want to validate.
3. Right click anywhere on said page and select "View page source".
4. Copy the source code and open the validator.
5. Select Validate by direct input and paste the code into the validator field and click "Check"

Below are the issues encountered during initial validation: 

**Home Page**

* A warning to add a language attribute to the html tag
* Several Info messages to remove trailing / from self-closing elements like img and link. 
* I discovered that these / were getting added automatically whenever I used the prettier command to tidy up the template code. 
    ![home-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/hmtl-val-homepage.JPG)

    ![all-messages](static/readme/testing/code-validation/trailing-slash-errors.JPG)

* The results after cleaning up these issues and re-deploying to heroku contain no errors:

    ![all-messages](static/readme/testing/code-validation/html-homepage-final.JPG)


[Back to top](#testing)

**Sign in Page**

* No errors

**Sign up Page**

* No errors

**Sign out Page**

* No errors

**Add booking form page**

* An attribute error for using "placeholder" with date input. The source of this error was in the forms.py date widget. I simply removed the placeholder attribute.
* The end tag error and unlcosed element were related. Both errors were dealt with upon locating the unclosed div and closing it.

    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/booking_form_validator_errors.JPG)

* The final results after addressing these issues contain no errors:

    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/add_booking-final.JPG)

[Back to top](#testing)

**Update booking form page**

* Unsurprisingly the same unclosed div error results occured on this page as the one in the booking form page. Since I create the update form template by copy, pasting and making adjustments to the booking form, this was expected and fixed in the same manner.


    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/update_booking_error.JPG)

* Final results after fixes:

    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/update_booking-final.JPG)


[Back to top](#testing)

**User Profile page**

* No errors


**Cancel appoinment confirmation page**

* An empty attribute value error for the form attribute action="".

    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/cancel_confirmation_error.JPG)

* Results after removing the unneeded attribute:

    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/cancel-page-final.JPG)


**404 page**

* No errors

[Back to top](#testing)
#

2. ### CSS Validation
CSS Validation was done using [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* One error occured for the .btn-secodary class. Too many values. 
* I am not 100% sure, but I think perhaps this error occured becasue I had already targeted the buttons with these rules somewhere else already.

![CSS](static/readme/testing/code-validation/css-validator-error.JPG)

* After playing around with this css for a bit I realised that the particular rule was not really making a differnece to the display and after commenting it out to be sure I decide to delete it.
* After double checking all my styles were working ok, I ran the css through the validator again and it came up clean.

![CSS_no_error](static/readme/testing/code-validation/css-validator-fixed.JPG)

[Back to top](#testing)

#

3. ### Python Validation
 Python Validation was done using the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).
 I used the gitpod problems tab to minimise python code errors as I went along, so there were not that many errors to address from passing the code through the linter. 

#### **Profject files**

**settings.py**
* Initial warnings for this file were as seen in this screenshot:

    ![settings-warning](static/readme/testing/python-code-validation/settings_warnings.JPG)

* The settings.py line too long warnings are from the django password validators. 
    ![settings-warning](static/readme/testing/python-code-validation/auth-password-validators.JPG)

* After consulting my own mentor and other mentors on slack, I left the too long lines in this particular case as they are part of the django automated code and splitting the string up might lead to unforseen issues. 
* The final validation results look like this:

    ![settings-warning](static/readme/testing/python-code-validation/settins_final.JPG)
