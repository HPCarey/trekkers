### Code Institute

This project is a variation and laregely based on the [Code Institute Moments](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) walkthrough project.
It contains styles and logic from that project which have bee modified for the prupose of this one.

### Resources for creating the star rating component: 
1.	[NPMJS: react-simple-star-rating]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-star-ratings) 
2. Geeksforgeeks: [Posititive Integer field](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/positiveintegerfield-django-models/)
2.	Stack overflow: [Set a default min/max value for inetger field](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42425933/how-do-i-set-a-default-max-and-min-value-for-an-integerfield-django)

### Bug fixes sources:
1. Due to a change in material by Code Institute to reflect their new IDE provider, I did not have access to the template for gitpod. As a result I had to deal with a lot of bugs in the setup and deployment stage, and any time a package needed to be installed. The list of sources for this as well as my troubleshooting steps and solutions can be found under the "Frontedn bug" label in [Issues](https://github.com/HPCarey/trekkers/issues).
